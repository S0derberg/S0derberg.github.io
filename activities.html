				<div id="title">Habonim Dror Camp Gilboa</div>
				<br>
				<div class="info">
					Habonim Dror is a Jewish youth movement focused on educating and empowering kid while they have fun and create lifelong bonds.  I spent all my summers from 2005 to 2014 at the Big Bear based summer camp; first as a camper, then as a counselor.  Throughout the year we have monthly events for the kids to see each other, continue learning, and sometimes act on the movement's values.  Two years ago I was the regional director of activities for the Bay Area, so I was in charge of the staff that planned and ran all the activities.  Know any Jewish kids looking for an amazing summer experience?  Send them to our <a href="http://www.campgilboa.org/" target="_blank">website</a>!

				<br>
				<div class="info">
					This is a group that I was involved with for all four years of my undergrad experience; JEWSE is a club for Jews (and non-Jews too) that major in the sciences or engineering (others welcome too) who like to hang out and build cool things.  I was vice president of the club for a year and then president for my senior year.  Check the club out <a href="http://jewse.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">here</a>!
